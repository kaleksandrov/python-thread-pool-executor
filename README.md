# Python Thread Pool Executor
## What is this?
This is an implementation of the **Thread Pool Executor** pattern written in **Python** langugage. I find it quite useful when writing multithreaded programs as the responsibility for managing the threads lies on the executor. This logic was officially added in version *3.2* of the languge but there are still tons of projects that are running on version *2.\** (like mine).

## How to use
Just copy this file somewhere in your project and import it. Here is a sample example of how to use the executor class:
```python
   from threadpoolexecutor import ThreadPoolExecutor
   ...

   def task1(value):
      """
      Operation that has to be executed in parallel.
      """
      ...

   def task2(value):
      """
      Another operation that has to be executed in parallel.
      """
      ...

   # Instantiate the executor with the desired number of threads.
   executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(16)

   # Launch the threads. At this point they are up and waiting
   # for a task to be submitted for an execution.
   executor.start()

   # Submit any number of tasks. When a task is submited if
   # there is a waiting thread, it starts executing it,
   # otherwise - the tasks remains in a queue. Once a thread
   # becomes available it checks in the queue for pending tasks.
   executor.submit(task1, value2, value3)
   executor.submit(task4, value5)
   executor.submit(task6, value7, value8, value9)
   executor.submit(task10, value11)
   ...

   # When you are ready you can request a shutdown on the executor.
   # This does not happen immediately. The executor will stop when
   # there is no pending task in the queue. However after the shutdown
   # is initiated no new task can be submitted. You can pass an optional
   # argument to the method that indicates if you want to block the
   # current thread and wait for the executor to be completely stopped
   # or you want this process to happen in the background while the
   # current thread continues its execution.
   executor.shutdown(True)
```
